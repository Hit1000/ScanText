2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
3. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

How they work:

1. Process inputs one timestep at a time
2. Maintain hidden state carrying past info
3. Train via Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)

Applications:

* Language modeling & text generation
* Machine translation
* Time series forecasting
* Speech recognition

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments LLMs with external knowledge retrieval.

Benefits:

1. Cuts down hallucinations
2. Injects up-to-date & domain-specific facts
3. Boosts factual accuracy & coverage

Process:

1. Index documents into a vector store
2. Retrieve top-k relevant chunks for a query
3. Concatenate context + prompt to LLM
4. Generate answer grounded in retrieved info

Use cases:

* Knowledge-base chatbots
* Document Q\&A systems
* Technical support assistants

## Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Overview

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) converts images of text into machine-readable text.

Pipeline:

1. Preprocessing (binarization, denoising)
2. Text detection (locate text regions)
3. Character segmentation (split into glyphs)
4. Character recognition (classify each glyph)

Techniques:

* Traditional engines (Tesseract)
* DL-based (CRNN, Transformer OCR)

Applications:

* Document digitization
* Invoice & receipt processing
* License plate recognition
* Handwriting recognition
