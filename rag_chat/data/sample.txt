This is a sample document for the RAG tutorial.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models by incorporating external knowledge sources.

Key benefits of RAG:
1. Improved accuracy with factual information
2. Reduced hallucinations
3. Access to domain-specific knowledge
4. Better reasoning with up-to-date information

RAG works by:
1. Indexing documents into a vector database
2. Retrieving relevant context when a query is received
3. Combining the retrieved information with the language model's capabilities
4. Generating accurate, contextual responses

This sample document demonstrates how RAG can retrieve this information when asked questions about RAG concepts.
