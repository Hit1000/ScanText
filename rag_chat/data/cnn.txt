## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) specialize in grid-structured data like images.

Core layers:

1. Convolutional layers (feature extractors)
2. Pooling layers (downsampling)
3. Fully connected layers (classification)

How they work:

1. Apply multiple learnable filters to input
2. Pool/stride to reduce spatial dimensions
3. Flatten & pass through dense layers for output

Use cases:

* Image classification (cats vs. dogs)
* Object detection (YOLO, Faster R-CNN)
* Image segmentation (U-Net)
* Video analysis
