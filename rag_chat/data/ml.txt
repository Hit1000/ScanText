## Machine Learning (ML) Overview

Machine Learning (ML) lets systems learn patterns from data without explicit programming.

Types of ML:

1. Supervised Learning (labeled data)
2. Unsupervised Learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
3. Reinforcement Learning (trial-and-error rewards)

Typical workflow:

1. Data collection & cleaning
2. Feature engineering
3. Model selection & training
4. Evaluation & deployment

Common algorithms:

* Linear & Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees & Random Forests
* K-Means Clustering
* Q-Learning
