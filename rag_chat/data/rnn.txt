## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Overview

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are built for sequential data.

Variants:

1. Vanilla RNN
2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
3. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

How they work:

1. Process inputs one timestep at a time
2. Maintain hidden state carrying past info
3. Train via Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)

Applications:

* Language modeling & text generation
* Machine translation
* Time series forecasting
* Speech recognition
