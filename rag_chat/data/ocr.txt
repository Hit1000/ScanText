## Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Overview

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) converts images of text into machine-readable text.

Pipeline:

1. Preprocessing (binarization, denoising)
2. Text detection (locate text regions)
3. Character segmentation (split into glyphs)
4. Character recognition (classify each glyph)

Techniques:

* Traditional engines (Tesseract)
* DL-based (CRNN, Transformer OCR)

Applications:

* Document digitization
* Invoice & receipt processing
* License plate recognition
* Handwriting recognition
